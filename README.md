# LeetCode-Insights-Dashboard-using-Tableau

A Comprehensive visualization for Analyzing Coding Performance and Trends.

# Introduction

The LeetCode Insights Dashboard is a multifaceted tool designed to offer invaluable insights into coding performance and trends on the LeetCode platform. With a diverse range of visualizations and filters,  It's packed with different tools to help recruiters, teachers, coders, data analysts, software developers, platform managers, researchers, schools, and interview coaches. It gives them all kinds of ways to look at data like graphs and options to filter information. With this dashboard, they can check how good candidates are at coding, keep an eye on students' progress, see which coding topics are trending, find interesting facts, and see how users are interacting with the platform. It's basically a must-have for anyone wanting to get better at coding or teaching it.

# Project Scope

Describe what the project aims to achieve, including the type of data being analyzed and the expected outcomes.

# Requirements

Software: Tableau Desktop (latest version) needs to be installed.

# Project Structure

PHASE 1: PLANNING

Objective: The document here outlines a project involving a dataset of LeetCode coding problems. The dataset includes details like problem IDs, difficulty levels, and topics. The project aims to create a dashboard for different users—like recruiters, educators, and programmers—to track progress, analyze trends, and evaluate coding skills. The dashboard will have features like filters, graphs, and reports to help users understand problem-solving patterns and performance. It’s designed to assist in education, recruitment, and improving coding abilities by providing useful insights from the data.

PHASE 2: DECISION MAKING

Objective: This phase involves visualizing a LeetCode dataset using Tableau to create interactive dashboards. Data preprocessing includes cleaning, transforming, and validating to ensure accurate insights. The dashboard will display various visualizations, such as pie charts, heat maps, and bar charts, to answer key questions about problem difficulty, acceptance rates, and engagement metrics. Filters and sliders will allow users to explore data based on difficulty and acceptance rates. The project aims to assist recruiters, educators, and programmers in analyzing coding problems for educational and recruitment purposes.

PHASE 3: DASHBOARD IMPLEMENTATION

Objective: This LeetCode Insights Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to provide detailed analysis of coding performance and trends on the LeetCode platform. It is tailored to meet the needs of diverse users, offering insights into coding challenges, user behavior, and problem-solving techniques. The dashboard's dataset includes a wide range of attributes like problem difficulty, acceptance rates, and submission counts, all of which are used to generate meaningful insights. Users can explore trends, identify challenging problem areas, and evaluate coding proficiency with this comprehensive analytical tool.
