Section 1: Used Visualization Tools
We will use Tableau to visualize the given data for several reasons:
1. Tableau offers the ability to create interactive dashboards that allow users to explore datasets in real-time. 
2. Tableau provides a wide range of visualization options, making it effective in representing different data attributes such as categorical variables and numerical metrics. 
3. The user-friendly interface of Tableau simplifies the process of creating visualizations, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. 
4. Tableau seamlessly integrates with external data sources, enabling the visualization of real-time or constantly updated data. 
5. Tableau is capable of handling large datasets efficiently, ensuring consistent performance regardless of the dataset size. 
6. With its publishing and sharing features, Tableau makes it easy for users to share and collaborate on visualizations.

Section 2: Explanation of required data pre-processing:
In our group project, we are focusing on visualizing the LeetCode dataset to gain insights into problem difficulty, acceptance rates, and engagement metrics. To ensure effective data preprocessing, we emphasize the importance of a collaborative approach. Here is a detailed outline of our data processing plan:

Data Cleaning
1. Identification of Missing Values: We will collectively review and determine the best approach to handling missing data in key columns like difficulty, acceptance, likes, dislikes, and discussion_count.
2. Imputation: In cases of missing numerical values like acceptance, we will reach a consensus on whether to impute using the median or mean based on the data distribution.
3. Removal: If the percentage of missing critical data is minimal and imputation could distort the data, we may opt to remove those rows.
4. Handling Outliers: Addressing outliers in numerical columns is essential.

Data Transformation
1. Normalization and Binning: We will normalize metrics like likes and dislikes as necessary and convert continuous data such as acceptance rate into categorical bins for specific visualizations.
2. Collaborative Binning Strategy: Categories like 'Low', 'Medium', 'High' acceptance will be established through discussion to simplify analysis and visualization.

Data Validation
1. Ensuring Consistency and Accuracy: Our team will guarantee the consistent application of transformations and cleaning steps throughout the dataset. We will validate the data to ensure it adheres to the expected formats and falls within the specified value ranges.
2. Previewing and Testing Visualizations: Prior to finalizing the dashboard, we will conduct a thorough examination of the data using test visualizations. This will help us identify any unforeseen issues or errors in data processing.
